description: "The first post of our Advent Design Patterns countdown, it's one of the Creational Patterns... the Builder Pattern!"
---

*Welcome to the first of my Advent Design Patterns series where I take a brief look at a design pattern, every day in the build up to Christmas! The reason why I've gone for brief overviews is because I think sometimes, less can be more (KISS, anyone?! Note the misteltoe Christmas pun!) and not everyone always wants to be drowned in text & UML diagrams. My goal is to keep each one of these a maximum of a 5 minute read. This post will cover one of the Creational Patterns, namely the Builder Pattern. If you're looking for a post on one of the other of the Gang of Four Design Patterns, you will most likely find them here.*

-----------------------------
## A Brief Overview
The Builder Pattern is a Creational Design Pattern that aims to separate the construction of a complex object *(an object is considered complex when it can be resembled by numerous permutations, sometimes based on some sort of internal logic. e.g. A car object representation... Silver Honda Civic, Red Honda Civic, Black Honda Accord)* from its internal representation *(e.g. an object class, within a codebase)*, alternatively aiming to facilitate a single construction process instead that can be used to create the different representations *(of that object)*.

By using this pattern, we can simplify the object construction process and refine it to allow easier creation of the different permutations of the complex object whilst also avoiding code repetition and increasing code re-usability.

There are two common variations of this pattern, namely the Builder Pattern alongside the Fluent Builder Pattern.

## The Builder Pattern vs. The Fluent Builder Pattern
The Builder Pattern will often result in a `Builder` and optional `BuilderDirector` class. Either or will contain methods that provide constructed objects accordingly that are favoured over using the standard object constructor. In the below example, our `BuilderDirector` contains a pre-defined method that returns a `Car` object pre-configured to match that of a Silver Honda Civic.

```csharp
var carBuilder = new CarBuilder(upgradeInventory);
var carBuilderDirector = new CarBuilderDirector(carBuilder);
Console.WriteLine(carBuilderDirector.BuildSilverHondaCivic().ToString());
```

Obviously it is possible to also instantiate a new Car and pass parameters in to the constructor to construct our object, however at scale and with a large number of parameters, this can become very tedious.

So, do not go wild and suddenly convert every object instantiation to use this pattern. Use it as a tool, only where necessary.

The Fluent Builder Pattern provides the exact same functionality to the regular Builder Pattern, however with a fluent interface/API to help facilitate the construction of complex objects. This makes life particularly easier for developers going forward within the same codebase. 

In the below example our `CarBuilder` is a Fluent Builder and provides us with a fluent interface to configure and create the exact car we want. 

```csharp
var customCar = carBuilder
                    .WithMake(Brand.Nissan)
                    .WithModel("Skyline")
                    .WithNumberOfDoors(4)
                    .WithColour(Colour.Black)
                    .Build();
```

The fluent API is a lot nicer to use and as you see fit, the possibilities to abstract complexity is endless. For example, you could abstract a group of constructor parameters at once if it is logical to do so.

```csharp
var customCar = carBuilder
                    .WithModel(Car.NissanSkyline)
                    .WithColour(Colour.Black)
                    .Build();
```

As a Skyline is always a Nissan and vice versa, along with always having four doors, it is possible to do something as the above. Within the above example, the `WithModel(Car.NissanSkyline)` method on the `carBuilder` somehow has been implemented to know that the enum `Car.NissanSkyline` needs to provide you a new `Car` with the correct brand, model and number of doors.

## A Brief High Level Overview
Whilst UML class diagrams work well for Design Pattern overviews, as I said in the introduction, I'm looking to keep things simple and avoid them throughout this Advent Design Pattern series.

Our Program can optionally depend on a `CarBuilderDirector` if we wish. If not as seen previously, we can call the `CarBuilder` directly to create the instances of `Car` which we need.

```
Program 
    -calls-> Director(ICarBuilder)
        --calls--> CarBuilder: ICarBuilder
```

```csharp
public class CarBuilderDirector
{
    private readonly ICarBuilder _carBuilder;

    public CarBuilderDirector(ICarBuilder carBuilder)
    {
        _carBuilder = carBuilder;
    }

    public Car BuildSilverHondaCivic()
    {
        _carBuilder
            .WithMake(Brand.Honda)
            .WithModel("Civic")
            .WithNumberOfDoors(4)
            .WithColour(Colour.Silver);

        return _carBuilder.Build();
    }

    public Car BuildRedToyotaYaris()
    {
        _carBuilder
            .WithMake(Brand.Toyota)
            .WithModel("Yaris")
            .WithNumberOfDoors(2)
            .WithColour(Colour.Red);

        return _carBuilder.Build();
    }
}
```

Within the below `CarBuilder` class we see one of the main perks of the Builder Pattern at play. We have some business logic that determines whether we can create a `Car` object with a specific upgrade, depending on whether it is in stock or not. 

When not employing the Builder Pattern, we might usually see this sit within the constructor of the `Car` object. Therefore by using a `CarBuilder`, we can separate the complex construction of the object from its internal representation, as per our initial definition of this pattern.

```csharp
public class CarBuilder : ICarBuilder
{
    private Car _car;
    private readonly IEnumerable<Upgrade> _upgradesInStock;

    public CarBuilder(IEnumerable<Upgrade> upgradesInStock)
    {
        ResetBuilder();
        _upgradesInStock = upgradesInStock;
    }

    public void ResetBuilder()
    {
        _car = new Car();
    }

    public ICarBuilder WithMake(Brand brand)
    {
        _car.SetBrand(brand);
        return this;
    }

    public ICarBuilder WithModel(string model)
    {
        _car.SetModel(model);
        return this;
    }

    public ICarBuilder WithNumberOfDoors(int numberOfDoors)
    {
        _car.SetNumberOfDoors(numberOfDoors);
        return this;
    }

    public ICarBuilder WithColour(Colour colour)
    {
        _car.SetColour(colour);
        return this;
    }

    // By using the Builder Pattern, we separate
    // this complex construction logic of the Car object
    // (which is based on whether an upgrade is in stock or not),
    // from the internal representation of the Car.
    public ICarBuilder WithUpgrade(Upgrade upgrade)
    {
        if (!_upgradesInStock.Contains(upgrade)) return this;
        _car.AddUpgrade(upgrade);
        return this;
    }

    public Car Build()
    {
        var builtCar = _car;
        ResetBuilder();
        return builtCar;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
TL;DR - If you find yourself with a complex object within your codebase that can be constructed in many different permutations and this is leading to lots of large constructors repeated everywhere and more headaches of that sort... then the Builder Pattern might be just what you're looking for.

If you spot any mistakes, do let me know as I am churning through these at a decent pace for advent! ðŸŽ…
