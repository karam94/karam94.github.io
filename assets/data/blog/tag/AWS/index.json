more about the world of Serverless, most tutorials on the internet that I could find around the .NET Core serverless world, seemed to revolve around writing a single individual serverless lambda function written in C# that does one small bit of functionality, sometimes utilising other AWS services to communicate with other lambda functions, all of which don't really exist within any sort of actual scaffolded project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/F5p9Uuz3F1a3S/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Joining the world of Serverless!\"></p>\n<p>This was all great and useful for learning purposes and also helped me understand the potential power of lambda functions. For example, the idea that you can have a small bit of code that can be triggered and run whenever you like... sets my imagination on fire!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ule4vhcY1xEKQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Joining the world of Serverless!\"></p>\n<p>BUT it deviated too much from my regular .NET Core developer workflow. I had questions on the developer scalability and developer experience of trying to replicate what was being taught on a larger scale - such as the first iteration a relatively large and complex CRUD-ish API. I just wanted something that got to the point and said, you have a fully blown .NET Core API that you wrote two years ago that you now want to run serverless-ly? Okay, here's what you do...</p>\n<p>For example if one needs to build a .NET Core API, chances are they will probably go for a quick:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">dotnet new webapi</code></pre>\n<p>...and take things from there. The .NET CLI will generate the project scaffolding needed and in a matter of seconds, you can do things like play around with middleware, create new controllers &#x26; so on.</p>\n<p>Whilst you can extract different bits of functionality in to lots of different smaller lambdas, I do believe that if you are entering the unknown and are building something brand new that exceeds a certain threshold of complexity, the problem at hand isn't a new problem. It's the old monolith-first strategy that we should be following and that monolith, may be a large API that all lives under one roof until we can actually start dissecting and extracting it in to smaller chunks later.</p>\n<p>So, I wanted to figure out if there was a way for me to develop my .NET Core Web APIs, following what I consider to be the general standardised workflow and then be able to deploy it as a serverless API as a whole, not having to worry about its modularisation as lots of smaller lambdas/functions. Basically, my deployment choices shouldn't affect my development choices. I should be able to deploy whatever I want, regardless of how it is written or its general size.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-serverless-framework\"><a href=\"#what-is-the-serverless-framework\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What is the Serverless Framework?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.readme.io/ffb4c59-Serverless.png\" alt=\"The Serverless Framework\"></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://serverless.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Serverless Framework</a> is an open source framework (that comes with an awesome CLI) that aims to help us configure and deploy serverless functions written in numerous technology stacks, to numerous cloud providers.</p>\n<p>If you've ever written and deployed a lambda function to AWS without using any sort of tooling (yes, I've been there... wrote a Python script to run every fortnight to check for redundant security groups etc...) you'll know how tiresome the process of zipping your code project up and uploading it is (or even worse, using the in-browser IDE thing) as well as having to then configure your lambda through the UI that AWS provide in the web console.</p>\n<p>This approach is usually okay for small projects such as my given example above of the single Python script for example (even though dealing with PIP dependencies was still a little tedious) but obviously it is not scalable. You also cannot commit your lambda's configuration to some sort of source control too which itself raises potential hiccups waiting to happen.</p>\n<p>The goal of the Serverless Framework quite simply, is to streamline your deployment process as much as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-alternatives-are-there-and-why-should-i-use-the-serverless-framework-in-particular\"><a href=\"#what-alternatives-are-there-and-why-should-i-use-the-serverless-framework-in-particular\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What alternatives are there and why should I use the Serverless Framework in particular?</h2>\n<p>Alternatives include AWS's very own <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SAM</a> or even the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/aws-serverless-applications-in-visual-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">official AWS Visual Studio tooling for Visual Studio</a>. </p>\n<p>However, I personally prefer using the Serverless Framework for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quite simply, I prefer its workflow due to the minimalistic CLI more to the alternatives.</li>\n<li>As I often use varied technology stacks when working on projects at home such as NodeJS or Python, the Serverless Framework's compatibility with these means I don't have to deviate away from what I'm used to when it comes to deploying my lambdas. If I decide to randomly try and deploy something to Azure one day, I don't need to learn some other way of deployment.</li>\n<li>The Serverless Framework comes with an incredibly healthy and large open source community behind it, which means there are plenty of plugins for it.</li>\n<li>The Serverless Framework allows you to debug your deployed lambdas, locally really easily within your IDE of choice such as Visual Studio Code which means you can utilise breakpoints &#x26; so forth. Note that this is not a unique feature of the Serverless Framework, but it is in this case, really easy to get it up and running which is cool.</li>\n<li>Whilst the AWS Visual Studio tooling may use a more familiar (to some) CloudFormation-style configuration file and the deployment process within the IDE is really quick (bar the fact that you need to have previously created an S3 bucket to upload your code to beforehand), it is essentially a dependency on having Visual Studio installed. So, if you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can't deploy your lambda and you'd probably end up running the Serverless Framework or something else in your CI/CD pipeline anyways.</li>\n<li>The Serverless framework automatically offloads the creation of an S3 bucket to host your uploaded artifacts off you and as a result, gets you from zero to hero as fast as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-will-we-be-doing-today\"><a href=\"#so-what-will-we-be-doing-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>So what will we be doing today?</h2>\n<p>We'll be taking a brand new .NET Core Web API project and deploying it as a single AWS Lambda. If one were to do this manually, it would not only require the setting up of AWS assets such as an S3 bucket &#x26; API gateway on top of the lambdas we create but it would also be a tiresome and very manual process.</p>\n<p>By the end of this post, you should have a deployed version of your .NET Core Web API that is triggered as a single AWS Lambda function with an API gateway that proxies requests through to all the routes you have defined within your controllers. The Serverless Framework will also handle an S3 bucket for your deployed assets to be uploaded in to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/QLvRBqfLXCphu/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Let&#x27;s begin!\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\"><a href=\"#prerequisites\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AWS</a> account.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://serverless.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Serverless Framework CLI</a> installed on your machine via <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NPM</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KngM5bfpttA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Your AWS account configured with your Serverless Framework CLI.</a></li>\n<li>An ASP.NET Core Web API to deploy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"dont-have-a-net-core-web-api-to-deploy\"><a href=\"#dont-have-a-net-core-web-api-to-deploy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Don't have a .NET Core Web API to deploy?</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> YourNewDirectory\n<span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> YourNewDirectory\ndotnet new webapi\ndotnet restore</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"integrating-the-serverless-framework\"><a href=\"#integrating-the-serverless-framework\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Integrating the Serverless Framework</h2>\n<p>The way the Serverless Framework knows how to handle your deployment process is through utilising a YAML configuration file called <code class=\"language-text\">serverless.yml</code> in the root directory of your project.

You get your first 1 million requests completely FREE... and then $0.20 for every 1 million requests thereafter.</p>\n<p>Requests can also translate in to compute time per month (400,000 GB-seconds), so whichever is hit first becomes your free threshold. You can read about AWS Lambda pricing in more detail <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The previously discussed method of defining a bunch of smaller, separated functions versus encapsulating a whole API within a single function, means you create an AWS lambda function for every HTTP endpoint you define. Meanwhile when going down the API encapsulation method as followed within this post, you are instead creating a single AWS lambda function.</p>\n<p>Logic therefore dictates that since all endpoint requests are then coming from your API Gateway to a single lambda rather than spread out over numerous lambdas, that you are therefore more likely to hit your free threshold sooner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I hope this article helps a lot of people who ran in to the same brick wall as me.

March 2019","timeToRead":8,"description":"From your hard drive to the AWS cloud in seconds!","content":"<p>I've been blogging a fair bit recently about a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Node.js</a> web framework - <a href=\"https://adonisjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AdonisJS</a> - and as I approach the end of the journey for the casual side project I was working on - which can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/karam94/ao.knowledgeshare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> (excuse the mess and lack of refactoring, but I prioritise sleep) - it was time for me to figure out how on Earth to go about deploying the darn thing.</p>\n<p>Being Node.js based obviously left me with several potential solutions, however as the application I have built is going to be trialled internally at work, it made sense to look towards the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AWS</a> route as that is where the majority of our cloud infrastructure lives.</p>\n<p>I needed the quickest, simplest solution I could get my hands on and unsurprisingly, that was in fact AWS's very own <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Elastic Beanstalk</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-aws-and-what-is-elastic-beanstalk\"><a href=\"#what-is-aws-and-what-is-elastic-beanstalk\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What is AWS and what is Elastic Beanstalk?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. If you've made it this far, you probably know what AWS is.\nAs for Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon themselves describe it as an \"easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, <em>Node.js</em>, Python, Ruby, Go and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger and IIS\".</p>\n<p>Bingo!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-elastic-beanstalk-work\"><a href=\"#how-does-elastic-beanstalk-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How does Elastic Beanstalk work?</h2>\n<p>There are several ways one can create a deployment environment in Elastic Beanstalk that in return will become a hosted instance of an application.</p>\n<p>The first step is to actually \"give\" your code to Elastic Beanstalk in some way, shape or form. The simplest way of doing this is quite simply by compressing our application in to a .zip file and then manually uploading it through the AWS Management Console website, following the on-screen instructions.</p>\n<p>However, the method that we're going to be taking a look at in this tutorial is a slightly more sophisticated way of getting your applications deployed through the use of the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI</a> instead.</p>\n<p>Once your code has been uploaded, Elastic Beanstalk then intelligently tries to figure out what technology your project is written in and then knows how to configure &#x26; run its magic to accommodate for you from there. For example, what you'll find in this tutorial is that when the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI realises we're uploading a Node.js based application to be deployed, it knows how to set up an Amazon S3 storage bucket for us, security groups, auto-scaling groups, load balancing, EC2 instances, CloudWatch alarms and so on for our environment. And yes, don't worry. Most of this sounded like mumbo-jumbo to me at one point as well and probably will continue sounding like mumbo-jumbo to you until you get stuck in!</p>\n<p>Awesome, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"this-all-sounds-familiar\"><a href=\"#this-all-sounds-familiar\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>This all sounds familiar...</h2>\n<p>Yep, you've used <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Heroku</a> (a Platform as a Service/PaaS) before and generally speaking - very high level - Elastic Beanstalk can be argued as AWS's answer to it.\nIn this case, both deploy to AWS infrastructure (EC2 for example is an Infrastructure as a Service/IaaS) and any premium you pay is going towards the costs of the platform/software that is running as a layer of abstraction on top of your infrastructure, to give you your smooth, flawless, automated and intelligent deployment experience that ends with a URL that is \"live\" and accessible.</p>\n<p>Heroku type PaaS solutions are ideal when your priority is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bypass the overhead of dealing with any sort of infrastructural complications and want to just get an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) deployed as soon as possible whilst also easily being able to make code changes and evolve based on user feedback as quickly as possible.</li>\n<li>You or your team significantly lacks Dev Ops knowledge - which is perfectly normal by the way. Dev Ops Engineers are becoming more prominent within our industry because these areas are becoming so broad and complex, Software Developers can't be expected to cram it all in as well!</li>\n<li>Your project has a low computational cost - such as a very small and simple application that costs pennies or pounds and therefore requires a small number of resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"step-1---installing-python-pip-and-the-elastic-beanstalk-command-line-tool\"><a href=\"#step-1---installing-python-pip-and-the-elastic-beanstalk-command-line-tool\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Step 1 - Installing Python, Pip and the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Tool.</h2>\n<p>I'm not going to re-invent or re-write the wheel.

Basically, groups are groups of policies. Policies are permissions. So over time you can essentially build a group for developers made up of the AWS permissions they should have and be limited to on your AWS account, the same for DBAs and so on.</p>\n<p>Upon defining our group, we have two options in our case. We can either do things properly and create an IAM user that only has privileges to modify our account's Elastic Beanstalk services - by attaching the <em>AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess</em> policy OR we can just create a master Administrator account that can do everything - by attaching the <em>AdministratorAccess</em> policy. Both will get the job done for us for the time being.</p>\n<p>Once you have created your user, opt to download the <em>credentials.csv</em> file as we will require this later.</p>\n<p>However, please bare in mind that I am no security expert. At the end of this tutorial, we terminate and teardown our deployed instance. If you're wanting to deploy something for a production environment then you probably want to actually put in more than just a couple of seconds consideration in to the IAM users set up on your AWS account. You can find more information about AWS Identity and Access Management <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-5---deploying-to-elastic-beanstalk\"><a href=\"#step-5---deploying-to-elastic-beanstalk\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Step 5 - Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk.</h2>\n<p>If you followed the bash script in Step 3, you should already be in the root directory of your new AdonisJS application. The reason why we installed the Elastic Beanstalk CLI is because it will ask you questions and guide you through setting up your deployment.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">eb init</code></pre>\n<p>The first step is initialising our Elastic Beanstalk settings for the application we're about to create. By following and answering the questions asked by the CLI, a \".elasticbeanstalk\" folder will be created within the root folder of our application containing a generated YAML file - yep, you guessed it - defining the settings we just chose. This will obviously get used during the deployment process.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 563 397'

or whatever suits your requirements best. Your credentials will be the access key and secret access key we downloaded in <em>credentials.csv</em> earlier in the previous step. </p>\n<p>The rest should be self explanatory except perhaps the parts about setting up SSH to your instances and regarding AWS CodeCommit.</p>\n<p>To cut a long story short, if you're unsure about an option, you probably don't need it so stick with the CLI's default. If you want more detail on AWS CodeCommit which you can read about <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to help you gauge more of an understanding of whether or not you want to also use it going forwards in conjunction with your projects as your preferred method of source control.</p>\n<p>In the scenario where you forgot to download <em>credentials.csv</em> you can simple re-navigate to IAM through your AWS Management Console and click on the <em>Security credentials</em> tab where you can <em>Make inactive</em> the previous access key and create a new one which will provide you with a new pair of keys.</p>\n<p>We've initialised our Elastic Beanstalk application so now we break applications down further in to different environments. These different environments will all be handled separately by AWS as one would expect. A different set of servers, different set of load balancers, etc.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">eb create</code></pre>\n<p>When creating your environment, AWS suggest their standard naming convention to your via the CLI. Bare in mind that whatever you choose as your DNS CNAME prefix will become your application's live domain name such as <em><a href=\"http://%7BYour-chosen-name%7Dadonis-elastic-beanstalk-dev.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://{Your-chosen-name}adonis-elastic-beanstalk-dev.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com</a></em>. You'll get asked some other stuff as well such as the type of load balancers you'd like, as always if in doubt go with the default option which in this case is <em>Application Load Balancing</em>.</p>\n<p>In context of this tutorial, we don't really care about more than one specific environment for now.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\"
