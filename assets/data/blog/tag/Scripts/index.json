It was also brought to my attention that the conflicted copies were being generated in the background every time a Dropbox sync happened on my Macbook Pro. I'm talking thousands of files almost every time a synchronisation happened... so it certainly wasn't a case of having all of these files open or being modified simultaneously. I've also formatted my Macbook Pro numerous time also and the problem never seemed to die down.</p>\n<p>So, I thought it was about time I came up with an automated solution of some sort to solve this issue. A bash script was the obvious solution that I can run every month or so to clean out the files. Not an ideal solution, but it gets the job done, right?</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> /YourDropboxLocation/Dropbox/\n<span class=\"token function\">find</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">.</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">grep</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"conflicted copy\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">while</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">read</span> i<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">do</span> <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">echo</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$i</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">\\</span>rm <span class=\"token string\">\"<span class=\"token variable\">$i</span>\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">done</span></code></pre>\n<p>The script is pretty straight forward. It simply runs in the root Dropbox directory, looks for all files which match the text \"conflicted copy\" using the grep command, pipes the files to a loop which iterates through all the found files and removes each and every single one.</p>\n<p>Now, the obvious hiccup occurs during the grep search command, where if we happened to have non Dropbox generated conflicted copy files (e.g. a file we have purposely called conflicted copy for some reason that isn't actually a Dropbox conflicted copy we want to delete) then that would get picked up as well and deleted. But other than that, I'd assume the chances of this occurring are incredibly slim.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I'm sure I'm not the only one with this issue and hopefully this little script helps you out :)</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
