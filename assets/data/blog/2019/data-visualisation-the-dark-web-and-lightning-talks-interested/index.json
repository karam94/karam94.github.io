I basically plan to go on a bit of a rant about how as people in tech and software developers in particular, we often take our \"circle of life\" for granted and as a result, we should all be aiming to give back more if not to the wider community, then at least our very own colleagues.</p>\n<p>I then go on to acknowledge some of the issues that hold people back regarding knowledge sharing such as a fear of public speaking and look at alternative people can still impact those around them.</p>\n<p>Conclusively, the point that I steer towards is that if we all put a little bit of extra effort in and do our little bit of knowledge sharing (because what goes around comes around, right?) in whatever way makes us more comfortable, the results can have a wider impact than many actually realise, which in return also automatically impacts customers positively.</p>\n<p>It might seem obvious, but more than often people become oblivious towards what impact they can really have on others.
